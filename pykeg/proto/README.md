# Kegbot `proto` files

Ages ago, we selected [Protocol
Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) to define Kegbot's
core models and aspects of the rest API. This directory stores the proto
definitions and the python generated code.

This code has been migrated from the [kegbot-api
repo](https://github.com/kegbot/kegbot-api) which is now deprecated.

## Other clients

At time of writing, the [Kegbot Android
App](https://github.com/kegbot/kegbot-android) also uses these protobuf
definitions.
