Overview
========

Kegbot Server is the web service behind Kegbot.  It serves as both the backend
and web UI for a Kegbot system. These instructions will guide you through
installing a new Kegbot server.

Prerequisites
-------------

Kegbot Server requires `Docker <https://get.docker.sh/>`_ to run, and
runs on any operating system that supports Docker. We have tested these
instructions on Linux and Mac OS X machines.
