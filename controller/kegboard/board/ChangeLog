  * ChangeLog: Started changelog for board files.

    drill holes.
  * kegboard-mini: Reworked RJ45 connector pinout, adding additional GPIOs in
    place of redundant GNDs.
  * kegboard-mini: Added jumpers to tie FLOW_A and FLOW_B to TEST_PULSE.
  * kegboard-mini: Added jumpers for GPIO_C and GPIO_D, allowing D6/D10 to be
