  * kegboard-coaster: Expand pcb board size to 1.50" x 0.70", more clearance
    for 0.1" pin headers.
  * kegboard-mini: Move temperature sensor away from ATmega328. 
  * kegboard-mini: Add new transistors to switch flow LED's.

  * kegboard-mini: Changed relay's to Omron SPDT (G5SB) Sparkfun COM-10509. 
    Expanded kegboard ~0.75" for larger relay footprint. Overall size: 4.05" x 2.10"
  * kegboard-mini: Changed TEMPERATURE-SENSOR, wrong pin wiring in Sparkfun library.
    Custom part available from https://github.com/geoffculp/GAC-Sparkfun-library-clone
  * kegboard-coaster: Changed TEMPERATURE-SENSOR.
  * kegboard-mini: Removed alarm header, moved ALARM pin to GPO header.
  * kegboard-mini: Adjusted standoff positions to match Arduino standoff holes.   
  * kegboard-mini: Added LED to ID-12 pin 10.
  * kegboard-mini: Added pin labels to LED's and buzzer.

  * kegboard-mini: initial (auto) routing of the board. TODO: fix up routing
    around relays, spacing of load traces.

  * kegboard-coaster: update to break out all pins; add PWR and GND headers.
  * kegboard-coaster: (auto) routed board.

  * ChangeLog: Started changelog for board files.
  * kegboard-mini: incorporated changes from Geoff Culp: added xbee reset logic,
    drill holes.
  * kegboard-mini: Reworked RJ45 connector pinout, adding additional GPIOs in
    place of redundant GNDs.
  * kegboard-mini: Added jumpers to tie FLOW_A and FLOW_B to TEST_PULSE.
  * kegboard-mini: Added jumpers for GPIO_C and GPIO_D, allowing D6/D10 to be
    pulled down conveniently. Decide a use for these later :)
  * kegboard-coaster: added first project files, also from Geoff.
